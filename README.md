# Hi there 👋
### My name is Luke! Call me Epic!


I am a software and game developer, I use and support free and open source software (primarily 😉).
I also compose music/design sound, play piano and let's just say my art skills are a little... questionable.


> I use and highly recommend Godot Game Engine, Visual Studio Code, Blender, DaVinci Resolve,
GIMP, Krita, Libresprite, Inkscape, Nuclino, Obsidian and of course GitHub!


I also use and support Godot Game Engine and it's language GDScript for game development.


💻 I am the owner of:
 - Incosmo, the software company
 - CosmoBot (in development)
 - Gecko Studios, the game development studio

🤖 __CosmoBot__ Experience an all new Discord! 👀

🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - JavaScript
  - Discord.js

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Feel free to reach out or to friend me on Discord: `EpicLuke#1234` - __DMs always open!__
